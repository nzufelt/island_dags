## The Island Artifact Mystery

**Scenario:**  
Four adventurers (**Ada**, **Blaise**, **Claude**, **Diana**) each began a journey across an island, carrying a unique artifact:

- **Ada**: Fabled Compass
- **Blaise**: Golden Jewel
- **Claude**: Hallowed Idol
- **Diana**: Ivory Figurine

You will receive information describing segments of each adventurerâ€™s journey (e.g., *"Ada was seen traveling from Shipwreck Beach to Mystic Lake"*).

**Important Rules:**  
- Each location was visited by **0, 1, or 2 adventurers**.
- When exactly two adventurers arrive at the **same location**, they **wait** until both travelers have arrived.
- When adventurers meet at the same location, they immediately **exchange artifacts**. They then continue on their paths after each exchange, carrying their new artifact.

**Your Goal (Collaboratively):**  
Determine **who ends up with each artifact** at the end of their travels.
