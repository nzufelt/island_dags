# Island DAGs

This is a small exercise that generates a puzzle for students to collaboratively solve involving a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Students are given handouts that contain the puzzle and island location information, as well as some amount of the edge data. Their job is to assemble the DAG and topologically sort it to find the answer to the puzzle.
